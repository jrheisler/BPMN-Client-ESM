### Notes for all functions:

* **`stream`** is an object that provides reactive behavior via methods like `.get()`, `.set()`, and `.subscribe()`.
* **`themeStream`** is used for theming and styling, where stream values are typically used to adjust colors, fonts, and other visual styles.

Each of these functions provides a reactive DOM element that automatically updates when the bound stream changes. The `applyStyles` method is common in some functions to ensure styles are applied dynamically based on the current theme. The DOM elements clean up automatically when removed from the DOM to prevent memory leaks.

Here’s the documentation for the additional functions, including descriptions, parameters, and return types:

Here’s the documentation for the Stream-related classes and functions:

---

### `Stream`

* **Description**: A class that represents a reactive stream of values. It allows you to subscribe to value changes, get the current value, and update the value, with support for integrating with objects that follow the JSON structure.
* **Constructor**:

  * `initial`: The initial value for the stream. If it's an object with a `json` and `key` property, the value will be extracted from that object.
* **Methods**:

  * `subscribe(fn)`:

    * **Description**: Subscribes to changes in the stream. The provided function (`fn`) will be called with the current stream value every time it changes.
    * **Parameters**:

      * `fn`: A function that will be called with the stream’s current value whenever it updates.
    * **Returns**: A function to unsubscribe from the stream.
  * `set(val)`:

    * **Description**: Sets a new value for the stream. This will trigger all the subscribers to update with the new value.
    * **Parameters**:

      * `val`: The new value to set.
  * `get()`:

    * **Description**: Gets the current value of the stream.
    * **Returns**: The current value of the stream.

---

### `derived(streams, transformFn, options = {})`

* **Description**: Creates a derived stream based on one or more source streams. The derived stream will automatically update whenever the source streams change. A transformation function (`transformFn`) is applied to the values of the source streams to compute the derived value.
* **Parameters**:

  * `streams`: A single stream or an array of streams to derive the value from.
  * `transformFn`: A function that takes the values of the source streams and computes the new value for the derived stream.
  * `options`: An object with optional settings:

    * `debounce`: A delay (in milliseconds) before applying updates, preventing excessive reactivity.
    * `distinct`: Whether to ignore updates if the derived value hasn’t changed (default is `true`).
* **Returns**: A new `Stream` that holds the derived value and automatically updates when the source streams change. It also has a `cleanup` method to remove the listeners when no longer needed.

---

### `fieldStream(sourceStream, fieldName)`

* **Description**: Creates a derived stream that tracks a specific field from the value of a source stream. It extracts the specified field from the stream's current value and updates the derived stream when the source stream’s value changes.
* **Parameters**:

  * `sourceStream`: The source stream to derive the value from.
  * `fieldName`: The name of the field to extract from the source stream’s value.
* **Returns**: A `Stream` that represents the value of the specified field from the source stream’s current value.

---

### `observeDOMRemoval(el, ...cleanups)`

* **Description**: Observes the removal of a DOM element (`el`) and automatically calls the provided cleanup functions when the element is removed from the document body.
* **Parameters**:

  * `el`: The DOM element to observe for removal.
  * `cleanups`: One or more functions to call when the element is removed from the DOM.
* **Returns**: None. The cleanup functions are invoked when the element is removed from the DOM, and the observer stops observing.

---

### Notes for all functions and classes:

* **Reactivity**: All `Stream`-based functions are designed to create reactive behavior, where updates to a stream trigger automatic updates to subscribed listeners, providing a dynamic interface.
* **Subscription Management**: `Stream.subscribe` returns an unsubscribe function, which allows for efficient memory management by detaching event listeners when no longer needed.
* **Derived Streams**: The `derived` function enables reactive calculations based on one or more streams, with optional debouncing and distinct value checks to manage performance.
* **Field Streams**: `fieldStream` is a simple way to focus on a specific property within an object stream, making it easier to manage complex data structures with individual properties.

These stream-based functions provide a robust way to manage dynamic data and handle reactivity in web applications, making them essential for building interactive UIs.

Here’s the documentation for the theme-related code you provided:

---

### `themes.json`

  * `theme`: The theme object to apply (e.g., one of the themes from the `themes` object).
  * `container`: The DOM element to apply the theme to (default: `document.body`).
* **Returns**: None. The function modifies the styles of the `container` element.

---

### Notes for all functions:

* **`currentTheme`**: A `Stream` instance that holds the current theme. It allows the theme to be dynamically updated and propagated to various UI components.
* **Persistence**: Themes are persisted using `localStorage`, so the user's theme preference remains even after they reload the page.
* **Reactivity**: Theme-related functions like `applyTheme` and `themedThemeSelector` are reactive, meaning they automatically update the UI when the theme changes.
* **BPMN Styling**: The themes also define styles for BPMN elements (e.g., shapes, connections), which can be used to apply a consistent visual theme across BPMN diagrams.

These functions and the `themes` object allow for easy theme management and dynamic switching in your web application, ensuring a personalized user experience.

const fullList = Stream(['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Avocado']);

const filteredList = derived([searchTerm, fullList], ([term, list]) =>
  list.filter(item => item.toLowerCase().includes(term.toLowerCase()))
);

const searchUI = column([
  editText(searchTerm, { placeholder: 'Search fruits...' }),

  derived(filteredList, list =>
    column(list.map(name => reactiveText(Stream(name))))
  )
], { gap: '1rem' });
```

## 12. **Loading Spinner with Delayed Data Load**

✅ **Goal**: Simulate a fetch call and show a spinner until it completes.

```js
const data = Stream(null);
const isLoading = Stream(true);

setTimeout(() => {
  data.set({ name: 'Loaded Data' });
  isLoading.set(false);
}, 2000);

const ui = conditional(isLoading, () =>
  reactiveText(Stream('Loading...'), { size: '1.2rem' }),
  () => reactiveText(derived(data, d => `Result: ${d.name}`))
);
```

```js
const items = Stream([
  { id: 1, name: 'Task A' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Task B' }
]);

const itemList = derived(items, list =>
  column(
    list.map(item => {
      const nameStream = Stream(item.name);
      return row([
        editText(nameStream),
        reactiveButton(Stream('Save'), () => {
          items.set(items.get().map(i =>
            i.id === item.id ? { ...i, name: nameStream.get() } : i
          ));
        })
      ], { gap: '1rem' });
    })
  )
);
```

## 14. **Confirmation Modal for Destructive Action (Reusable Pattern)**

✅ **Goal**: Ask before deleting a user.

```js
const users = Stream(['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']);

const ui = derived(users, list =>
  column(list.map(name => {
    return row([
      reactiveText(Stream(name)),
      reactiveButton(Stream('Delete'), async () => {
        const ok = await showConfirmationDialog(`Delete ${name}?`, currentTheme);
        if (ok) {
          users.set(users.get().filter(n => n !== name));
        }
      })
    ], { justify: 'space-between' });
  }))
);
```

## 15. **Tab View Using Stream State**

✅ **Goal**: Toggle between views using tab buttons.

```js
const tab = Stream('info');

const tabButtons = row([
  reactiveButton(Stream('Info'), () => tab.set('info')),
  reactiveButton(Stream('Settings'), () => tab.set('settings'))
], { gap: '0.5rem' });

const tabView = derived(tab, t => {
  if (t === 'info') {
    return reactiveText(Stream('This is the info view'));
  } else {
    return reactiveText(Stream('Settings go here'));
  }
});

const ui = column([tabButtons, tabView], { gap: '1rem' });
```

## 16. **Form with Validation and Error Feedback**

✅ **Goal**: Show errors if fields are empty before saving.

```js
const name = Stream('');
const error = Stream('');

const form = column([
  editText(name, { placeholder: 'Name' }),
  reactiveText(error, { color: 'red' }),

  reactiveButton(Stream('Submit'), () => {
    if (name.get().trim() === '') {
      error.set('Name is required');
    } else {
      error.set('');
      showToast(`Submitted: ${name.get()}`, { type: 'success' });
    }
  })
]);
```

---

## 17. **Multi-Step Wizard**

✅ **Goal**: Navigate through multiple steps with “Next” and “Back”.

```js
const step = Stream(0);
const maxStep = 2;

const steps = [
  () => reactiveText(Stream('Step 1: Intro')),
  () => reactiveText(Stream('Step 2: Info')),
  () => reactiveText(Stream('Step 3: Review'))
];

const wizardUI = column([
  derived(step, s => steps[s]()),

  row([
    reactiveButton(Stream('Back'), () => step.set(Math.max(0, step.get() - 1))),
    spacer(),
    reactiveButton(Stream('Next'), () => step.set(Math.min(maxStep, step.get() + 1)))
  ], { gap: '1rem' })
], { gap: '1.5rem' });
```

---

## 18. **State-Driven Diagram Info Panel**

✅ **Goal**: Show a versioned BPMN overlay and update via streams.

```js
const name = Stream('Loan Workflow');
const version = Stream(2);
const overlay = createDiagramOverlay(name, version, currentTheme);

// Later:
version.set(version.get() + 1);
```

You can place this directly over the canvas.

## 19. **Dynamic Grid With Row Selection and Highlight**

✅ **Goal**: Click on a row to highlight it.

```js
const data = Stream([
  { id: 1, title: 'A' },
  { id: 2, title: 'B' },
  { id: 3, title: 'C' }
]);

const selectedId = Stream(null);

const grid = derived(data, rows =>
  column(rows.map(row => {
    const isSelected = derived(selectedId, id => id === row.id);

    return container(
      reactiveText(Stream(row.title)),
      {
        bg: derived(isSelected, selected => selected ? '#aae' : '#eee'),
        padding: '0.5rem',
        border: '1px solid #ccc',
        margin: '0.25rem 0'
      }
    );
  }))
);
```

---

## 20. **Dropdown-Driven Form Switching**

✅ **Goal**: Pick a mode from a dropdown, and show a different form per selection.

```js
const mode = Stream('login');

const modeOptions = Stream(['login', 'register']);

const loginForm = column([
  editText(Stream(''), { placeholder: 'Email' }),
  editText(Stream(''), { placeholder: 'Password' })
]);

const registerForm = column([
  editText(Stream(''), { placeholder: 'Email' }),
  editText(Stream(''), { placeholder: 'Username' }),
  editText(Stream(''), { placeholder: 'Password' })
]);

const formSwitcher = derived(mode, m => m === 'login' ? loginForm : registerForm);

const ui = column([
  dropdownStream(mode, { choices: modeOptions }),
  formSwitcher
], { gap: '1rem' });
```

## 🧠 Recap: Design Patterns in Use

| Pattern                                           | Description                          |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `derived` views                                   | Declarative logic for computed state |
| `conditional`                                     | Controlled DOM insertion             |
| `Stream` + `editableDropdown`                     | Controlled components                |
| `column` / `row` layout                           | Reusable, themeable layout system    |
| `showConfirmationDialog`                          | Modal interaction pattern            |
| `toast`, `avatarDropdown`, `createDiagramOverlay` | High-level utilities for UI          |
| `spacer()`                                        | Implicit layout tension / alignment  |
